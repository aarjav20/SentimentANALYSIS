# SentimentAnalysis
This is sentiment analysis of twitter data. Dataset have been taken from https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/ twitter sentiment analysis hackathon problem.
In this Primarily three machine learning classification models have been used:-
1) Linear SVM
2) Random Forest Model
3) XgBoost Model

The metric used for evaluating the performance of classification models is F1-Score.
Considering the F1 score of these models , the Random forest classification model performed best and beats the Linear svm model by narrow margin where as Xgboost model performed less compared to prior models.
F1 score of respective models for final test data:-
Random Forest Model :- 0.705479452054794
Linear SVM :- 0.704273504273504
XgBoost Model :- 0.577861163227017

Future scope :-
1) Proper tuning of Xgboost model to improve results
2) Adding more efficient methods of cleaning the data for improved performance of models
